Question 1
1(a) Define acceleration. [1 mark]
- Student answer: "Rate at which the objects velocity changes over time."
- Award: 1/1 (B1). Clear, correct definition.

1(b)(i) Calculate time for object A to reach the ground. [2 marks]
- Student used s = ½ a t^2, substituted values and gave t = 1.7 s.
- Award: 2/2 (C1, A1). Correct method and correct numerical value.

1(b)(ii) Use your answer in (b)(i) to calculate u. [2 marks]
- Student wrote the correct equation s = ut + ½ a t^2 and substituted the values, but obtained u = 5 m s^-1 (arithmetical error). The method/substitution is shown correctly.
- Award: 1/2 (C1). Method mark awarded; final numeric mark not awarded due to incorrect arithmetic (answer should be ≈ −6.2 m s^-1).

1(c)(i) State and explain whether the time for B to reach the ground is less/same/greater. [2 marks]
- Student answer: "It will take greater than the previous time as the vertical component of velocity is smaller."
- The correct conclusion is "less time" (because B reaches a lower height), so the student's conclusion is incorrect.
- Award: 0/2.

1(c)(ii) By considering energy, state and explain effect on speed at which B reaches the ground. [2 marks]
- Student answer: "Speed to reach ground is same as the potential energy is same irrespective of the angle θ."
- Award: 2/2 (B1, B1). Correct energy reasoning and correct conclusion.

Question 2
2(a) State the principle of moments. [2 marks]
- Student answer: "The sum of all clockwise moments must be equal to sum of all the anti-clockwise moments to be in equilibrium."
- Award: 2/2 (B1, B1). Correct.

2(b) Calculate x. [3 marks]
- Student set up moments correctly (including weights × distances), solved and gave x = 1.3 m.
- Award: 3/3 (C1, C1, A1). Correct method and correct result.

2(c)(i) Calculate the spring constant of the spring. [3 marks]
- Required: x = 0.80 − 0.59 = 0.21 m (C1) and k = (60×9.81)/0.21 ≈ 2800 N m−1 (A1).
- Student used incorrect values/arithmetical result for x and gave k = 0.15 N m−1 (incorrect).
- Award: 0/3. No method mark evidenced leading to the correct substitution/result.

2(c)(ii) Calculate the elastic potential energy of the spring. [2 marks]
- Student used appropriate relation (½ F x) and obtained elastic potential energy = 62 J (shown in the answer space).
- Award: 2/2 (C1, A1). Correct final value.

Question 3
3(a) Define power. [1 mark]
- Student: "The total amount of work done per unit time."
- Award: 1/1 (B1). Correct.

3(b)(i) Power transmitted to the wheels. [2 marks]
- Student: P = 1750 × 35 = 6.1×10^4 W.
- Award: 2/2 (C1, A1). Correct.

3(b)(ii) Useful work done over 17 km. [2 marks]
- Student: W = 1750 × 17 000 = 3.0 × 10^7 J.
- Award: 2/2 (C1, A1). Correct.

3(b)(iii) Calculate the current in the motor (600 V, efficiency 85%). [3 marks]
- Student used efficiency relation and found I = 120 A.
- Award: 3/3 (C1, C1, A1). Correct.

3(c)(i) Effect of slope on air resistance. [1 mark]
- Student: air resistance is the same as speed is the same / forces balanced.
- Award: 1/1 (B1). Correct.

3(c)(ii) Effect of slope on current in the motor. [1 mark]
- Student: current is smaller because gravitational potential energy is being converted (so motor produces less useful power → smaller current).
- Award: 1/1 (B1). Correct.

Question 3 total: 10/10

Summary
- Question 1: 6 / 9

Overall total awarded: 23 / 29

General feedback (brief)
- Good treatment of kinematics and energy parts; many correct methods shown.
- Arithmetic/sign error in 1(b)(ii) — method present so one method mark awarded.
- Incorrect conclusion in 1(c)(i) lost two marks (be careful to link vertical component magnitude to time correctly).
- In 2(c)(i) the spring calculation contains wrong values/arithmetics; ensure careful subtraction for extension (0.80 − 0.59 = 0.21 m) and consistent use when calculating k. The elastic energy (2(c)(ii)) was correctly calculated.
- Presentation of working is generally clear — when the method is clearly shown, method marks are awarded even when final arithmetic is wrong.
